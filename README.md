# ChemSpiderTool
~~A py script to transfer CAS number to Name and SMILES by querying it on ChemSpider.com. (Use Selenium)~~  
Now you can use api_request.py to finish this work. You need to get a developer account [here](https://developer.rsc.org/) and use official web api.

## How to use it
~~You need a Python 3.X environment with Selenium and Chrome webdriver. These can be easily found by Google.~~  
You need a Python 3.X environment and [ChemSpiPy](https://github.com/cameronneylon/ChemSpiPy#chemspipy)

## 如何使用
Python 3.X环境，使用[ChemSpiPy](https://github.com/cameronneylon/ChemSpiPy#chemspipy)库直接与api交互。需要自己申请api。
